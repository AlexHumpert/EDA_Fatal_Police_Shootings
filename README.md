## Data Cleaning
After loading the data to my Jupyter Notebook, I needed to clean it up to explore it. I made the following changes: 
* Made columns for months and year
* Deleted columns with missing values

## Insights
Some of the findings are detailed below: 
* The typical victim of a fatal police shooting is a 34 year-old white, male with signs of showing a mental illness. He is most likely to be shot in January, and is armed and attacking officers with said weapon upon being fataly shot.  
* Although representing just 13% of the total US population, African Americans are significantly overrepresented in fatal police shooting data, representing 26% of all fatal police shootings.
* The top four states account for approximately 33% of all police shootings in the USA.
